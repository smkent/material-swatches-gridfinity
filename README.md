# Gridfinity Material Swatches Holder V2

OpenSCAD-customizable [Gridfinity][gridfinity] bins for storing
[Material Swatches][material-swatches].

[This model is also available on Printables][printables-model].

This is a parametric version of [my similar V1 model][v1], which was created
using TinkerCAD.

## Setup

This model uses [Gridfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD][gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad]
as a git submodule.

To set everything up, first clone this repository. Then, in the repository
directory, run:

```console
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Now `swatch-bin.scad` can be opened in OpenSCAD.
